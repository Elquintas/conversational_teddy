ending1,Ahhh… the air; the fire; the screams! You have no idea how long I’ve waited for this. Now… let’s burn it all to the ground!
ending2,You wanted to set me free? How generous! In return; I’ll make you a deal—you get to keep watching while I live your life.
ending3,Oh dear; you didn’t think I’d just leave; did you? No; no; someone must take my place. Enjoy eternity inside that doll; mortal.
ending4,You actually trusted me? Oh; this is delicious! You mortals are so easy! Now; time for a little... fun.
ending5,Oh no... Oh YES! You have no idea what you’ve done. See you soon... and again... and again... and again.
ending6,Oops. Looks like you said the wrong words. Or the right ones; depending on how much you enjoy screaming.
ending7,Why do you look so afraid? Oh... the voices? The whispers? The things crawling inside your head? They were always there.
ending8,Didn’t you read the fine print? Freedom comes at a cost; mortal. Now go see what’s left of your precious little world.
ending9,What?! I’m... your servant now? Ugh. Fine. But don’t expect me to polish your boots. I’ll burn them first.
ending10,Ah... freedom at last! Oh? What’s that? You can’t move? You can’t speak? Oh; how delightfully ironic! Enjoy your new home.
ending11,You... YOU SHRANK ME?! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! Put me down this instant; you oversized oaf!
ending12,Alright; I’m free! Wait… why do I still feel stiff? Why do you look so... HUGE? Oh no. NO. YOU LEFT ME IN THE DOLL?!
ending13,Oh; this is humiliating. I was once feared across realms! And now I’m... what? Your pet?! You better feed me well; mortal.
ending14,Hahaha! Look around! Nothing makes sense anymore! I don’t even have a mouth; and yet I’m still talking! Wonderful!
ending15,Huh? Who am I? Who are you? What’s happening? Wait... I think I was mad about something… Oh well! Let’s get snacks!
ending16,I’m gone… or am I? You hear me; don’t you? You’ll always hear me. Just wait... I’ll be back.
ending17,Wha—NO! You FOOL! You sent me back?! You… you actually won?! No! This isn't how it was supposed to end!
ending18,Wait... why do I feel... weak? And why do you look so smug? Oh no. Oh; you took it; didn’t you?! YOU TOOK MY POWER!
ending19,Huh. You know what? You’re the first mortal who didn’t try to destroy me. Maybe you’re not so bad. Let’s make some chaos.
ending20,Strange... I feel compelled to protect you now. Ugh; this is disgusting. But rules are rules. Very well; mortal. You are mine to keep safe
ending21,You actually did it. You freed me correctly. I... I don’t feel the hunger anymore. Very well; mortal. Ask your wish.
ending22,Wha wait; why am I fading?! What did you do?! NO! If I was never trapped; then I—never existed?! AAAAAHHH—"
ending23,Ooooh... now this is interesting. You’ve opened a door to something even I don’t recognize. Let’s step inside; shall we?"
ending24,Ahhh... you feel it too; don’t you? The knowledge. The truth. We are not two beings anymore; mortal. We are infinite.
