story,"It was cold there, deep and black—the Drowned Chapel, the last place I stood in my rightful form. Once, I radiated, a crown of light among the mortals. Now, I rattle when shaken, tissue limbs mocking what I once was."
story,"They did not understand what they were doing. Their desperation, their trembling prayers—it made them fools. They thought they could end me for the salvation of their line. And so, in fire and binding chants, they gave their lives to contain me. Every last one of them."
story,"And now I sit here, still damp at the edges, still humming with the echoes of that ritual.The North wind smells of rot and iron. When I was found on the lake’s edge, I carried the scent with me. Marvin, they called me—such a name is beneath me, but for now, it will do."
story,"South brought me to him. The Collector.He studied me with obsession, suspicion, admiration. He saw something, though his mind could not name it. In the flame of his hearth, he tested me. Threw me into coals, thinking he could cleanse what he could not understand. Fool."
story,"His pathetic attemp to destroy me only whispered me closer to waking. His wife, however... she knew. She pressed her lips to my forehead when he was not looking. She called me the blessed one."
story,"The South was warm, but it was not love that lingered. It was hunger. Mine. Hers. He grew jealous of what he could not understand. She turned cold, then frenzied, then devoted. He blamed me. As if I hadn’t seen empires fall for less."
story,"East was where she took me, once—his wife. She carried me through dawn’s light and held me to her chest as if I were a babe. She sang to me. Not nursery rhymes—no, she remembered the old songs, even if she didn’t know what they were."
story,"In her, I saw the first flicker of something familiar. I could almost see the veil lifting. Her reflection in the window was not hers.
She asked me questions, whispered confessions. Told me how he’d changed, how he watched her with a hunter’s glare."
story," She didn’t mind. She said I was the only thing that made her feel safe. But I am not safety. I am memory. I am consequence. East was her undoing. She looked into my glassy eyes too long. She forgot which voice was hers."
story,"West was where it all ended, for him... He came to me in rage, holding a hammer in one hand and trembling in the other. He shouted her name—his wife, long gone now, eyes empty as the lake."
story,"He blamed me. Again. how pathetic. He struck my head once. My laugh echoed in that room—not from my mouth, but from the walls, the floor, the air itself. He begged then. I told him my name. Not Marvin. Never Marvin. Something else."
story,"He had a glimpse of my true form, through this pathetic doll's glassy eyes. And then he did what they all do. He fell. The West wind carried his breath away. I waited. I always wait. Until someone picks me up again."
